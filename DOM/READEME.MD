explanation of the difference between the `async` and `defer` attributes in HTML `<script>` tags:

**Async**:

- The `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script in parallel with parsing the HTML document.
- Once the script is downloaded, it is executed immediately, even if the HTML parsing is not complete.
- Scripts with the `async` attribute are executed in the order they are downloaded, which may not be the same order as they appear in the HTML.
- `async` is useful for scripts that are independent and do not rely on the DOM or other scripts.

**Defer**:

- The `defer` attribute also tells the browser to download the script in parallel with parsing the HTML document.
- However, the key difference is that the script execution is deferred until the HTML parsing is complete.
- Scripts with the `defer` attribute are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document.
- `defer` is useful for scripts that depend on the DOM or other scripts, as it ensures they execute in the correct order after the page has finished loading.

In summary:

- `async` downloads and executes the script asynchronously, as soon as it's available, potentially interrupting the HTML parsing.
- `defer` downloads the script asynchronously, but executes it only after the HTML parsing is complete, preserving the execution order.

The choice between `async` and `defer` depends on the specific needs of your application. `async` is better for independent scripts that don't rely on the DOM, while `defer` is better for scripts that depend on the DOM or need to execute in a specific order.
